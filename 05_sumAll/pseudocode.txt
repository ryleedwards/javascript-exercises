Take two numbers >> num1, num2

example: 1, 4 
add 1, 2, 3, 4 together
example 6, 11
add 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 together 
loop is going to execute (difference between two numbers + 1) times

Need to create loop that is iterated the difference between the two numbers + 1 
Need to find difference between the two numbers.
    Use Math.abs() function.

Need to determine whether num1 or num2 is greater bc we need to add 
        numbers IN BETWEEN, regardless of how it is passed

If statement >> if (num1 LESS than num2), execute and count UP

ELSE if (num1 GREATER than num2), execute and count down
