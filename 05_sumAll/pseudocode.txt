Take two numbers >> num1, num2

example: 1, 4 
add 1, 2, 3, 4 together
example 6, 11
add 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 together 
loop is going to execute (difference between two numbers + 1) times

Need to create loop that is iterated the difference between the two numbers + 1 
Need to find difference between the two numbers.
    Use Math.abs() function.
